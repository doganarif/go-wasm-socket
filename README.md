# Go WebSocket WebAssembly Example (WIP)

This project demonstrates how to set up a WebAssembly (WASM) module using Go, with a focus on establishing a WebSocket connection and interacting with the DOM from Go.

## Introduction

WebAssembly allows you to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client-side execution. This project specifically showcases the use of Go to handle WebSocket communications and update the DOM accordingly.
